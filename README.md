## 🌍 Impact-Oriented Projects  

### [OrionGIS](https://orionterrametrics.co.ke/CloudGIS.html)  
A cloud-based GIS platform that integrates spatial data, IoT streams, and enterprise systems for **real-time utility monitoring, infrastructure management, and decision support**. I architected and implemented the platform using **proprietary and open-source GIS technologies**, ensuring **scalability, reliability, and high performance**.  

### [Orion Spatial Data Hub](https://orionterrametrics.co.ke/OrionSpatialDataHub.html)  
A centralized spatial data repository for **organizations managing multiple geospatial datasets**. It enables **secure storage, data sharing, visualization, and analytics**. I led the design and development of the hub, emphasizing **interoperability, efficiency, and practical impact** for utility and environmental management.  

### Other Selected Work  
- Utility network GIS integration (water & energy) for operational monitoring and analytics.  
- Web & mobile GIS solutions for infrastructure mapping, asset tracking, and environmental monitoring.  
- Spatial data pipelines and dashboards that transform raw geospatial data into actionable insights.
