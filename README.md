# Hi 👋, I’m Godwin Murithi

**GIS & Geospatial Infrastructure Architect | Utility & IoT‑GIS Integrator | Data & Spatial Systems Developer**  
Based in Nairobi, Kenya

## 🔎 What I Do Today  
I design and build GIS infrastructure and geospatial systems — with a focus on integrating IoT, utility network modelling (water & energy), spatial analytics and data-driven decision support for utilities, infrastructure, health and environment sectors. I bring together survey data, remote sensing, GIS platforms, cloud services, and spatial‑data models to deliver real‑time, actionable spatial intelligence.  

I also develop web and mobile GIS applications for mapping, monitoring, and analytics — often using geospatial frameworks combined with backend services and databases.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools  

- **GIS & Spatial Data**: PostGIS / PostgreSQL, PostGIS‑enabled spatial databases, geospatial data modelling, spatial analytics, remote sensing, raster & vector data processing, utility network mapping & analysis.  
- **IoT & Utility Monitoring**: Integrating GIS with IoT data streams (water / energy utilities), spatial analytics for network health, real‑time monitoring and alerting (where applicable).  
- **Web & Web‑GIS Development**: Python (backend), GeoDjango or similar GIS‑enabled frameworks, web mapping (Leaflet / other JS libraries), APIs, data ingestion & processing pipelines.  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Docker (or containerization), cloud hosting (for GIS & data services), data pipelines, scalable spatial‑data infrastructure.  
- **Data Science & Spatial Analysis**: Spatial statistical analysis, remote‑sensing analysis, GIS analytics, data-driven spatial insights.  
- **Surveying / GIS Integration for Utilities & Infrastructure**: GIS network modelling, mapping utility infrastructure (water, power), integrating with asset management or utility‑management systems.  
- **System Architecture & Integration**: Bridging GIS, IoT, databases, and enterprise systems (e.g. hospital systems, utility management platforms).

## 🌍 What Drives Me / My Focus  

- Building **modern utility management systems** for water and energy using GIS + IoT + spatial analytics — with a view to help utilities modernize, reduce losses (non‑revenue water/leakage, inefficient energy distribution), and make data‑driven decisions.  
- Developing **spatial‑data infrastructure** for clients: allowing integration of disparate data (survey data, sensor data, infrastructure layers, GIS layers) into unified systems.  
- Creating **web/mobile GIS solutions** that enable visualization, mapping, analytics, and real‑time monitoring for utilities, health, environment, and infrastructure projects.  
- Helping organizations **transition from traditional/manual systems to digital, GIS-enabled systems**.  
- Exploring **remote sensing, data science, and geospatial AI** for environmental monitoring, utility asset monitoring, and infrastructure analytics.

## 🤝 Open for Collaboration & Opportunities  

I’m actively open to collaborating on open‑source or commercial projects where GIS, IoT, utilities, spatial analytics or infrastructure modernization play a role. I’m particularly interested in projects that:

- involve **utility network modelling / management**,  
- require **integration of GIS with real‑time data (IoT, sensors)**,  
- build **scalable spatial‑data systems and services**,  
- leverage **remote sensing, spatial analytics or geospatial data science**, or  
- aim to **modernize legacy infrastructure / systems using GIS and data technologies**.
